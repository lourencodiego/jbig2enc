First, read the file PATENTS in the same directory as this file.

Fetch leptonica from its website (http://leptonica.com/) and build it.
For this you will also need the standard libtiff, libpng and libjpeg.

If you're running a Unix-like OS, such as Linux, BSD, Mac OS X or msys
 just run:

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install (or sudo make install)


VC++ 2008 Notes
===============

Download leptonica-1.68-win32-lib-include-dirs.zip from
http://leptonica.com/download.html and unpack it so 'include', 'lib' and
'jbig2enc' directories are at the same directory (or adjust include path
in VC++ project).

Download stdint.h for Microsoft Visual Studio (part of package
msinttypes-r26.zip from http://code.google.com/p/msinttypes/downloads/list)
and place it to 'include' directory.

Them open vs2008/jbig2enc.sln in Visual C++ 2008 and build solution.
